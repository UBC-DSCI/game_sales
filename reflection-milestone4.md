# Game Sales Dashboard

## Reflection

Designing a rough sketch and implementing it from scratch to a full-blown Game Sales Dashboard has been an interesting experience. As a team we learned how to implement our ideas coming from the team's different backgrounds to build an informative Dashboard for newcomers or investors in the gaming industry .

Here are the plots we implemented in this Dashboard:

Four charts that aid our stakeholders who are investors in the gaming industry get quick insights on the gaming market:

   - The first chart shows the sales trend across various regions.  The chart has the capability to filter out by video game genre, which makes it useful to see the evolution and the sales performance of a specific genre over time and across markets.

   - The second chart isolates the evolution of sales per genre and per region, this plot does not show comparisons. The purpose of this plot is to make it easier for the user to spot specific trends in market, i.e the evolution of sales of Rancing Games in Japan.

   - The third chart displays the  ranking of copies sold by video game publisher. This bar plot allows to change ranking size by using a slider, the chart is useful to check the publishers that dominate the industry.

   - The fourth chart shows the game copies sold by platform. It shows how successful has been a video game manufacturer in terms of of games sold by console.

We consider that the backend  functionality of the dashboard is correct, all the charts work correctly as we expected at the beginning of the project, all the selections are responsive.  A future improvement to our dashboard that has not been implemented in this project is a world map of video game sales that we think would be useful to the user of our application to identify the most important markets.

As a limitation we identified that we cannot show more specific information about the video games companies, this is because the dataset has general information about markets. Collecting specific data from companies would be helpful to build  more profitability metrics for the game investor persona.

In particular, we found useful the front-end feedback received from our classmates. We did not recieve TA feedback but based on the peer review, we found out that our first version of the app had some features in the layout of the dashboard that users found difficult to understand.  For example,  the tooltips information and the functionality of some buttoms in the control panel was not clear because the lack of titles and labels. We addressed this feedback in the current Milestone and we consider that these changes improved the user's experience of the app.

Finally, we were able to replicate the same backend functionality for  DashR and DashPy. The only difference between these apps is in the frontend. In DashR, we considered that a menu at the top of the app with all the widgets would allow a better user experience, so we implemented that in Milestone 4.

Overall, we consider that the app is a useful tool for users interested in the video game market.
